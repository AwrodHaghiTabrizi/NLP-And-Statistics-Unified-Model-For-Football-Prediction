Earlier this term Van Gaal’s men went 11 games unbeaten in all competitions of which only four were victories. The current sequence is five with three wins.

They played brilliantly last Monday in their 4-0 win at Stoke, after Leicester had dropped points, and they are hell-bent on letting the leaders know that if the door is left open, they will charge through it. Mauricio Pochettino has banned his players from going to Sunday’s PFA awards dinner, because he will not allow the focus to slip before Monday night.

At least Bilic has a full squad to choose from for the trip to the Hawthorns, with striker Andy Carroll hoping to build on a run of six goals in his last six games.

Stoke City have beaten Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City at home but Crystal Palace will look to capitalise on their poor away form this season. However, Mark Hughes will be extremely motivated to put Stoke’s bitter penalty loss to Liverpool in the Capital One Cup semi-final behind them with victory . Charlie Dear"

There were times this season when being comfortably safe on the last day looked highly unlikely for Swansea, and while the decision to award Francesco Guidolin the job full-time this week was a surprise, it was a deserved one. The Italian has probably done enough since succeeding Garry Monk to deserve a crack at a season from the start. Paul Chronnell"

Burnley should give a debut to Johann Berg Gudmundsson but he is their only outfield signing so far – Aston Villa’s Ashley Westwood may follow – and there are concerns that last season’s Championship winners are thin on numbers and quality. Swansea must adjust to losing Ashley Williams and André Ayew in quick succession and the match comes too soon for record signing Borja Bastón. Both squads should look stronger at the month’s end but a negative start could be hard to claw back. Nick Ames

This remains the south coast club’s only major honour so Claude Puel’s 2017 vintage have the chance to make real history.

The Portuguese also has a fine pedigree in the competition, having won it three previous times. It seems unlikely, then, that Southampton can repeat their 1976 feat. But this is a final and, as they proved, anything can occur. Jamie Jackson"

Arsène Wenger is unconcerned. He knows the underdog can have its day and he referenced the 2005 FA Cup final, when his Arsenal team “had no players available” but somehow beat Manchester United. It could be Diego Costa’s last game in Chelsea colours but probably will not be Wenger’s last at Arsenal. David Hytner"

This might not be reasonable but in English football’s boom-and-bust culture it is just the way it is. Claude Puel’s side are unbeaten in the league since 10 September and up to eighth but it will still be a shock if the leaders are unable to defeat them. Jamie Jackson

Liverpool have never lost a top-flight league game at home to Stoke – a sequence stretching back 53 games – although Mark Hughes’s team were the last to win at Anfield in the League Cup back in January.

However, following the home defeat to Crystal Palace, Liverpool cannot afford another slip-up at Vicarage Road against a Watford side who have reached 40 points yet look unlikely to get too many more. Yet Jürgen Klopp will have unpleasant memories of last season’s 3-0 mauling at Vicarage Road and it should serve as a warning against complacency. Paul Chronnell"

But the Potters have won only once in their last nine games and a bottom-half finish looks increasingly likely. That will only count as regression when Mark Hughes’s performance is assessed at the season’s end but they can at least show that some things remain the same with a rousing performance against opponents that tend to bring the bet365 Stadium to life.

They lost, crucially as it turned out, to Liverpool on the opening day; Arsène Wenger knows a fast start is important this time around to make the idea of a new beginning more sellable and he will be buoyed by aspects of the Community Shield performance against Chelsea. His team look especially lively down the flanks: can they conjure up a nerve-settling early goal for their big signing, Alexandre Lacazette, or will Leicester’s own new boy Kelechi Iheanacho steal the show?

A problem Roy Hodgson has to solve though is Palace’s goal tally of zero from eight away games. Leicester, meanwhile, have only failed to score once at home this season against Manchester City. Hodgson should be very wary of baiting Claude Puel’s revitalised Foxes. Graham Searles"

West Ham are on an upward trajectory after thrashing Huddersfield Town and will be confident of gaining revenge for Callum Wilson’s controversial equaliser in their 3-3 draw with Bournemouth on Boxing Day. Yet the visitors are only a point behind David Moyes’s side after their battling win over Arsenal. It could be a nervy afternoon. Jacob Steinberg"

Tottenham are unbeaten in five while Southampton’s winless league run stretches to 10 games – including a 5-2 Boxing Day thrashing by Spurs. The home side’s only win over Spurs since returning to the Premier League came in May 2016, and was also their last league win over a side in the current top six. Mauricio Pellegrino’s focus now is on the bottom six – Southampton play the other five teams presently in that bracket in the next seven games, so anything gained on Sunday will be a bonus.

Virgil van Dijk became the sixth and last of them in January, and the £75m Dutchman is assured of a rough reception from the home crowd for the manner of his departure, while Adam Lallana, sent off in midweek for the under-23s, may find a place on the bench.

Javi Gracia will be keen to capitalise on their poor away form and record his second win as manager. If Abdoulaye Doucouré can dominate midfield, as he always does when Watford have been at their best, then three important points are achievable. Graham Searles"

Pardew seems to recognise the importance of moving quickly on from the Barça business and the best way to do that is with a desperately needed win against Huddersfield. However the signs are not promising for Albion. Pardew has won once in 13 league matches as manager at the Hawthorns and David Wagner’s side were excellent in their 4-1 rot-stopping win over Bournemouth. Graham Searles

Sam Allardyce, like Hughes another merry-go-round perennial to take over in the dugout since Saints defeated Everton 4-1 in October’s reverse fixture, reckons he has won “the hearts and minds” of the Everton majority with their home performances and insists the dissenters are a vocal minority. Some were evident when Everton won their last home game, against Newcastle, with their only shot on target, but many were more so during the 2-0 win at Huddersfield later that week.

Darren Moore, even only in his capacity as a caretaker, has mustered 11 points from five matches, claimed the manager of the month award for April and endured relegation on Tuesday. The hope – and it is only a hope as yet – is he is given a chance to take up the reins on a permanent basis. Dominic Fifield"

Preserve an unbeaten home campaign against a Brighton team that has won twice on the road all season and Liverpool are in the Champions League for a second year running. As a side note, Mohamed Salah needs one more goal to become Liverpool’s record scorer in a Premier League campaign. He is currently level with Luis Suárez’s 31 goals in 2013-14. Andy Hunter"

Mark Hughes would give his prospects of staying an added boost with a return against the club who sacked him in 2009 and he has urged Saints to make a quick decision for next season. “It’s a well-run club, good club, and a good opportunity for whoever gets it,” said Hughes who arrived only in March. If City win they will set more records, however, for the most away wins in a Premier League season with 16, and the most points on the road, 50. “In the last few weeks these numbers have helped us keep focus,” said Guardiola, whose players secured the title on 15 April.
