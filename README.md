# NLP-And-Statistics-Unified-Model-For-Football-Prediction

This project aims to predict football match outcomes by combining natural language processing (NLP) and statistical team data. Inspired by the paper "[Combining Machine Learning and Human Experts to Predict Match Outcomes in Football: A Baseline Model](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/17815)" by Beal et al., this repository enhances traditional models by integrating expert opinions from match previews and running dynamic team statistics to create a comprehensive, unified prediction model.
